Configuration Specification
===========================

Configuration is done in through an INI style config file, which is searched
in the following order:
 $HOME/.tfwmrc
 $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/.tfwmrc

An example configuration file can be found in the examples/ directory.

If no configuration file exists, tfwm will fallback to the default keybinds
(set in `keys.c`).

Lines can be commented using either a semi-colon (;) or octothorpe (#) as the
first character of the line.

In the "keybinds" section, "Mod1" refers to the modifier mask used in key
combinations. You can use the xmodmap(1) utility to find which modifier a key
corresponds to. Generally, Mod1 is the Alt key and Mod4 is the Windows/Super
key.
